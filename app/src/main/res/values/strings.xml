    <string name="about_cmd">The Centre for Management Development (CMD) is a resource
        institution established in 1973 by the Federal Government of Nigeria as the operational
        arm of the Nigerian Council for Management Development (NCMD), which has over-all responsibility
        for the stimulation, promotion and training in the public and private enterprises of
        the Nigerian economy. Though established in 1973, it was Decree 51 of October 4, 1976
        that gave both the Council and the Centre their legal status.

        \n   \t \t In 2004, the Centre’s mandate was enlarged when the Federal Executive
        Council in-line with the Federal Government’s reform policy approved the merger
        of CMD and the National Centre for Economic Management and Administration (NCEMA),
        Ibadan. Through the merger, CMD assumed the additional responsibility to strengthen
        the skills of public officers involved in economic planning, budgeting, project
        design, implementation and monitoring as well as economic policy formulation and implementation.
